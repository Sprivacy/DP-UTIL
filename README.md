# Machine-Learning-with-Differential_Privacy
Machine Learing with Differential Privacy: For Objective Perturbation, we used IBM Differential Privacy Library
For Gradient Perturbation: Tensorflow Privacy Library
All the installation was done within Google colab
For datasets: You have to add their path manually to your code

1. For LendingClub Loan Datasets with logistic Regression: Please run DP__Perturbation_logisticRegression_loanData.ipynb
2. For LendingClub Loan Datasets with DNN: DNN_Perturbation_loanData.ipynb
