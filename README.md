# DP-UTIL: Comprehensive Utility Analysis of Differential Privacy in Machine Learning

Machine Learing with Differential Privacy: For Objective Perturbation, we used IBM Differential Privacy Library
For Gradient Perturbation: Tensorflow Privacy Library
All the installation was done within Google colab
For datasets: You have to add their path manually to your code
